# Online Bookstore - School Project
This is an online university bookstore that gives room for users to view the books available for rent, or for sale.
This program also accepts sale of books from users who intend to sell their pre-loved books in good condition.
The program is developed as a CMS with an admin panel for both admins, users and employees.
